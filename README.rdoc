Since the app uses Facebook, we create two Facebook accounts that you could use:

Account 1: email: 591059716@qq.com, password: 3217132, name: Taone TA

Account 2: email: 415493163@qq.com, password: 3217132, name: Christine Lin

They are already each other's Facebook friend.

MVP features:

* 1. User authentification: Users could create an account and log in/out through Facebook.

* 2. Profile sharing: All users of Trippy could see each otherâ€™s profile, including free dates, destinations
interested in going and acceptable budget range.

* 3. Trip creation: Users can create a trip and invite other users to join.

* 4. Activity planning: Users suggest activities to do on a trip and vote for their desired
activities. 

Note that access control is not yet implemented. (For example, a user could see a trip that he does not create or join. )

Ruby version 4.0
